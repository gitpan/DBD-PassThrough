NAME
    DBD::PassThrough - Pass through DBD

SYNOPSIS
        use DBI;

        my $orig_dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:SQLite::memory:', '', '', {RaiseError => 1});
        my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:PassThrough:', '', '', {pass_through_source => $orig_dbh});

DESCRIPTION
    DBD::PassThrough is a proxy module betwen DSN to $dbh.

    You can pass a existed $dbh as a new DBI connection's atribute.

    THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. API MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

WHY?
    Some of the DBIx::* modules do not accepts $dbh as a argument, but
    arguments for "DBI->connect". Then, it makes hard to use DBD::SQLite as
    a mock DB.

  SCENARIO
    I want to use DBD::SQLite's on memory database.
    I need to prepare on memory database(CREATE TABLEs, etc.)
    But DBIx::FooBar module does not accepts $dbh.
    Then, I need DBD::PassThrough.
